/*
 OBJC refresher
 Syntax is different:
 - when declaring a var, we start with the type that that instance will be.
- var a = 10? keyword var doesn't exist, and there's no type inference
 
 We'll have to manage the memory (sometimes).
 - Ex: autoreleasepool sets a scope for you to declare variables, do stuff with them, and then at the end of the block, whatever is in memory will be told to release.
 
 Object-Oriented Language! (OOP)
 - not protocol oriented -> so true
 - 4 pillars: encapsulation, *inheritance*, abstraction, polymorphism.
 
 First! We're gonna talk about the functionality that ObjC gets from a different language.
 
 Swift compiles into Swift, which compiles into some Swift-y kind of thing (SIL) and then gets set up to be actual instructions to the computer
 
 Objective C does not compile to itself. C and its functionality sit below ObjC, and so when we compile our code, at one point all the stuff we write will be in C. After that, it'll get set up to be actual instructions to the computer.
 
 Digression: most languages compile to an intermediary language called Assembly, which is the layer of code that gets translated to the hardware of our computers.
 Digression over.
 
 First: let's do some C stuff.
 After: Let's do some ObjC stuff.
